### Guidelines 
- Always go methodically and step by step. For all changes plan your steps and then do the code generation
- This is not an enterprise level apps. This is for small and medium businesses 
- Keep things simple. Try simpler things first before going into more complex setups. But that does not mean you create bad solutions. Use judgment when a simple solution would work versus when a more complex is necessary required. Objective is to get a good functional app
- When making changes, make targeted changes as per the step by step plan. Do not make unnecessary changes not requested for as an app functionality might break.
